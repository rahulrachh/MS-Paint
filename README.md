Created MS Paint version in Python. It contains main.py file and utils folder. You run the main.py and see the following screen.

The utils/settings.py file has the settings. Go to that file to change the window size/update the row/columns or channge the pixel size of FPS.
Read the comments before changing the values to avoid the program from crashing.
